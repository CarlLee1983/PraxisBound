# Story: <ID> <Title>

## Goal

Describe the user or business outcome.

## Context

Relevant background necessary to understand the change.

## Classification

Both declarations are required. `yes` makes the matching section below
mandatory.

* Security sensitive: no
* Baseline conformance: no
* Task mode: execution

`Task mode` is optional and defaults to `execution`. Use `architecture` for a
boundary, ownership, contract, or migration decision; `evidence` for inspection,
review, or diagnosis that must not change the repository; and `mixed` when the
Story contains both.

## Authority

Optional. Delete this section to accept the documented defaults for the task
mode. Every operation is declared as `yes` or `no`, and being able to perform an
operation is never authorization to perform it.

* plan: yes
* modify: yes
* add_dependency: no
* migration: no
* commit: no
* push: no
* deploy: no

## Architecture

Optional. `Impact` defaults to `low`; delete this section for a Story that
carries no architecture weight. `Impact: medium` or `high` must name at least
one decision or contract. Each `Decision` resolves to a record under
`specs/decisions/` unless the invocation sets `PRAXISBOUND_DECISIONS_ROOT` to an
existing ADR directory.

* Impact: low
* Decision: `ADR-001`
* Boundary: `BoundaryName`
* Contract: `BoundaryName public interface remains compatible`
* Owner: `BoundaryName = owning-domain`

## Risk

Optional. `Level` defaults to `low`; `medium` and `high` must name at least one
reason. Risk raises inspection and verification depth. It never widens scope.
Each reason is one non-empty same-line backticked signal, such as
`versioned-surface`; prose and a closing backtick on a later line are invalid.

<!--
Optional risk signals:
error-projection
concurrency
bounded-capacity
retention-overflow

Declaring a signal activates its corresponding readiness contract. Add only
the Error Projection, Concurrency, Capacity, or Retention and Overflow section
that the Story needs; see protocol/story.md for its exact fields.
-->

* Level: low
* Reason: `signal`

### Optional focused verification

Optional. Omit the fenced declaration below to require full `make verify`.
Use `Scope: full` to state that obligation explicitly. Focused scope is valid only when repository
policy permits it. Declare every required check layer with one exact command:

```markdown
## Verification Scope

* Scope: focused
* Surface: executable
* lint: `make lint-changed`
* static: `make static-changed`
* unit: `make unit-changed`
```

Executable work retains the risk and architecture layers from
`protocol/verification.md`. For low-risk, low-impact documentation-only work,
use `Surface: documentation` and one `documentation` command instead. A Story
requiring the full gate must not select focused scope.

guidance is relevant. -->

## Trust Boundary Fields

Required when `Security sensitive: yes`; otherwise delete this section. Name
every user-controlled or externally derived field the requirement covers,
including custom metadata, derived summaries, evidence labels, error details,
and external references.

* `field.name` — where the value enters the system

## Superseded Behavior

Required when `Baseline conformance: yes`; otherwise delete this section. Name
each existing test or documented behavior this Story intentionally replaces.

* `path/to/test` — the behavior that must change and why
